‚Ä¢	Business Problem
Steelbird Helmets, a leading helmet manufacturer, needed deeper insight into sales trends, product performance, and return reasons across India to improve distribution, product development, and customer satisfaction. With fragmented data across dealers, regions, and models, drawing clear insights for strategic decision-making was challenging.

‚Ä¢	Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a centralized, interactive, and visually intuitive view of helmet sales, returns, ratings, and regional performance. The dashboard enables sales leaders, supply chain analysts, and product managers to:
 ‚Ä¢ Track total and dealer-wise sales.
 ‚Ä¢ Analyze return reasons and return rate by product.
 ‚Ä¢ Evaluate customer satisfaction via ratings.
 ‚Ä¢ vAssess performance across regions and helmet types.

‚Ä¢ KPIs:
  Displays total sales (486M), total units sold (150K), average rating (3.75), and return rate (0.50%).

‚Ä¢ Return Reasons (Donut Chart):
  Shows that the majority (58.4%) of returns fall under ‚ÄúOther‚Äù reasons; size issue, damaged products, and wrong items also contribute.
‚Ä¢ Total Sales by Dealer:
  Top dealers include SafeRide Gears (83M) and GearUp Moto (82M), suggesting dealer-specific sales strength.
‚Ä¢ Sales Trend (Line Chart by Month):
  Seasonal sales patterns with visible dips mid-year.
‚Ä¢ Product-Level Analysis:
  Bestselling models: SBA-3 Robo (51M), SBA-2 Terminator (50M).
  Ratings per model show consistency (~3.73‚Äì3.76).
  Return rate by model is mostly stable at ~0.50%, with SBH-17 slightly higher (0.51%).
‚Ä¢ Heatmap by Region:
  High-performing states: Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat (~61M each). Rating and return rates remain stable across regions.
‚Ä¢ Sales by Helmet Type & Size:
  Modular and Half Face helmets are top-selling types; XS and M sizes lead unit sales.

‚Ä¢	Business Impact & Insights

1. Sales Efficiency:
Top 6 dealers account for a large chunk of sales, providing an opportunity to replicate success factors across other dealers.
2. Return Reason Analysis:
While 58% of returns are ambiguous (‚ÄúOther‚Äù), addressing clearer return logging could reduce loss and improve products.
3  Stable Product Performance:
Most products have a uniform return rate and rating, indicating good quality consistency.
4. Regional Focus:
High sales in states like UP, Rajasthan, and Gujarat highlight regional strengths. These can be used for targeted marketing and distribution.
5. Customer Preferences:
Demand for XS/M sizes and Modular helmets could guide inventory and production decisions.
